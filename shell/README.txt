Build steps (summary):
1) From TwitchMind/shell, run: npm i
2) Start (dev): npm start    (assumes your server is already running on http://127.0.0.1:4173/)
3) Build installer: npm run build
The output EXE will be in TwitchMind/shell/dist; include that EXE in your main NSIS installer or install it separately.
