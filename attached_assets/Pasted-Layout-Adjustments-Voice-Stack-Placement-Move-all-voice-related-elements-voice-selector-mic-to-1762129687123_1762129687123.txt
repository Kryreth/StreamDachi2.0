Layout Adjustments:

Voice Stack Placement:

Move all voice-related elements (voice selector, mic toggle, live transcription, AI rephrase output) to the left side of the monitor view.

StreamDashi Window:

Place it on the right side of the monitor.

Must use a fixed size — no auto-scaling/responsive scaling.

🎙️ Voice Features:

Mute / Unmute Mic:

Toggle to silence mic input.

Voice Changer Dropdown:

Allow switching between available voices on the fly.

Live Transcription Toggle:

Add a button to pause/resume transcription manually.

Label clearly, e.g., "Pause Listening" / "Resume Listening".

AI Rephrase Output Refresh:

Ensure the AI output box clears and refreshes after every rephrased response.

No stale or old output should linger.

Wait Mechanism (Timing Improvements):

Add a “done speaking” detection, then:

Wait 500–1000ms after last detected speech.

Then process transcription → send for rephrasing → show response.

This ensures no overlap between voice and response.

🔧 Replit AI Prompt (Copy + Paste)

Reorganize and fix the StreamDachi monitor layout and voice system:

Layout Changes:

All voice-related controls and outputs (mic toggle, voice changer, live transcription, rephrased output) go to the left side of the monitor.

The StreamDashi display moves to the right side and must use a fixed size (disable any auto-scaling or CSS that causes dynamic resizing).

Voice System Enhancements:

Add a mute/unmute mic toggle.

Add a dropdown to change the selected voice.

Add a Pause/Resume button for the live transcription service.

Fix the AI rephrase output so it clears and refreshes after each new input/response cycle.

Add a “wait” mechanism:

Detect when the user is done speaking (silence or mic idle).

After ~500–1000ms delay, submit the transcription for rephrasing.

Wait for the AI response before allowing the next input.

Keep UI elements clearly labeled. Use flexbox or grid as needed to align left/right columns cleanly. No placeholder logic — real functionality only.
